## v2.x

### v2.10.1

Maintenance release.

Bugs fixed:

 - MANTA-5189 Bump artedi dep from 1.x to 2.x.

### v2.10.0

New minor release, due to addition of new API.

API changes:

 - Recovery objects now accept an optional property `delaySpread`, to control
   the magnitude of randomization applied to `delay`
 - DNS resolver-related stats counters have been added to the kang endpoints.

Bugs fixed:

 - #151 DNS resolver no longer falls back to 60 second retries in error cases
   if it has previously seen a valid TTL.
 - #150 Many cueball errors are now VError subclasses, with improved error
   messages and chaining back to their original cause.

### v2.9.0

New minor release, due to addition of new API.

API Changes:

 - The connection interface now has a new optional function it can implement,
   `setUnwanted()` which allows for optimising behaviour for connection types
   that do extra work before emitting `connect` (e.g. authentication)

Bugs fixed:

 - #148 cset with n=1 holds onto dead connections

### v2.8.0

New minor release, due to addition of new API.

API Changes:

 - The `Pool` constructor now accepts a new option, `maxChurnRate` to constrain
   the maximum per-backend connection churn rate of the pool.

### v2.7.1

Maintenance release.

Bugs fixed:

 - #144 slot failure immediately after removal from resolver leads to sadness

### v2.7.0

New minor release, due to addition of new API. The v2.6.0 release was
mistakenly published with only the `Pool` part of the API change.

API changes:

 - The `Pool` and `Set` classes now both accept a new constructor option --
   `decoherenceInterval` which allows increasing the interval of the
   decoherence/shuffle timer.

### v2.5.3

Maintenance release.

Bugs fixed:

 - #138 added `isStopped()` method to `Agent`.

### v2.5.2

Maintenance release.

Bugs fixed:

 - #140 Fix bug in pool statistics gathering

### v2.5.1

Urgent maintenance release: node-moray, a notable consumer, was broken
by v2.5.0 (by depending on undocumented behaviour in the API)

Bugs fixed:

 - #134 fix for #116 broke node-moray (SRV timeouts no longer leading to
   fallback to A/AAAA records)

### v2.5.0

New minor release, due to addition of new API.

API Changes:

 - The `Pool` class now has a method `getStats()`, which returns a snapshot
   of the Pool instance's counters along with four additional numbers:
   total connections, idle connections, partly-open connections, and the
   number of requests queued on available connections (#132)
 - The `Pool` class has a new option, `targetClaimDelay`, to allow configuring
   target claim timeouts to help with managing long, overloaded claim
   queues (#128)

Bugs fixed:

 - #116 timeout on SRV should avoid triggering fallback to A/AAAA -- this helps
   to prevent "flapping" between A and SRV record lookups
 - #115 handle REFUSED responses as name not known, which modern SDC binders
   now produce for records outside of their area of authority

### v2.4.0

New minor release, due to addition of new API.

API Changes:

 - The `Agent` method `createPool()` now accepts a `port` option, as well as
   various TLS-related options (#125)

### v2.3.0

New minor release, due to addition of new API.

API changes:

 - The `Agent` class now has methods `getPool()` and `createPool()`, which
   enables inspection of its internal state, as well as injection of a custom
   Resolver (#122, #124)
 - Pools and Sets now have a new method `getLastError()` (#80)

Bugs fixed:

 - #123 ConnectionSet memory leak during failure
 - #120 Documentation improvements

### v2.2.9

Maintenance release.

Bugs fixed:

 - #118 slot should retain reference to previous claim handle (helps in
   debugging some types of claimer misbehaviour)
 - #112 docs improvements
 - #119 bump min version of mooremachine to get timestamps (another debugging
   aid, to see how long claims took to process)

### v2.2.8

Maintenance release.

Bugs fixed:

 - #113 spurious error handler leak warnings when using Agent. This is also
   MANTA-3331 and MANTA-3204
 - #114 cueball agent breaks HTTP Upgrade

### v2.2.7

Maintenance release.

Bugs fixed:

 - #111 smgr fixes in 2.2.6 forgot 'error' states -- possible crash resulting
   from mistake in fix for #108

### v2.2.6

Maintenance release.

Bugs fixed:

 - #108 crash: unhandled smgr state transition -- issue which most commonly
   happens due to HTTP requests that time out while stalled (buffers full)
 - #109 Agent "health check ok" log msg needs domain name of pool (also adds
   a bunch of other useful attributes to that log message)

### v2.2.5

Maintenance release.

Bugs fixed:

 - #107 Bootstrap resolver not stopped when the last resolver using it
   stops

### v2.2.4

Maintenance release.

Bugs fixed:

 - #106 want INFO logs when backends are shuffled into the top N for
   pool/set, and when resolver adds/removes records (only after first
   successful lookup)

### v2.2.3

Maintenance release.

Bugs fixed:

 - #105 Agent pinger logs at INFO level on success. Much logs. Very noise.

### v2.2.2

 - Fix-up for 2.2.1 being broken (lib/agent.js missing)

### v2.2.1

Maintenance release.

WARNING: This release is broken. Do not use it.

Bugs fixed:

 - #102 HTTP Agent pinger hangs. HttpAgent's "ping" option has been broken
   since 2.0.0.
 - #103 pinger running should not trigger creation of more connections

### v2.2.0

New minor release, due to addition of new API.

API changes:

 - The `DNSResolver` class is now exported in the package root, as specified
   in the documentation. It was mistakenly left out.
 - Users of `ConnectionSet` can now supply the option `connectionHandlesError`
   to avoid the need to add a no-op `"error"` handler when using a `constructor`
   that already handles errors.

### v2.1.1

Maintenance release.

Bugs fixed:

 - #92 ConnectionSet emits 'removed' for connection it never 'added' -- this
   release is now actually safe to use with Moray.
 - #93 kang payload missing "options.domain" etc -- makes Kang snapshots a lot
   easier to read
 - #95, #79, #97 logging improvements, reduction of many ERROR level logs to
   WARNINGS since applications may not treat a given cueball pool as fatal
 - #96 crash in Pool#on_resolver_removed when FSM already stopped, happens most
   easily in cases where there is nameserver "flapping"
 - #94 ConnectionSet needs better protection against removing its last working
   connection
 - #98 test coverage for Kang monitor

### v2.1.0

New minor release, due to relaxation of API requirements.

API changes:

 - `Connection` interface implementations (i.e. implementers of the objects
   that are returned by the `constructor` parameter) are no longer required to
   implement `#ref()` or `#unref()`.

Bugs fixed:

 - #85 documentation improvements and re-organization
 - #26 clarified that programs that wish to exit cleanly without calling
   `process.exit()` must call `.stop()` on agents or pools.
 - #90 ensure cueball works with node 0.10
 - #88 correct a bug that cause a crash bringing up a backend after pool failure

### v2.0.1

Bugs fixed:

 - #86 pool monitor broken on csets (kang endpoint always returns InternalError)

### v2.0.0

New major release, due to API change in `ConnectionSet`.

API changes:

 - `ConnectionSet` now requires the use of handles to indicate when connections
   have been drained.
    * Client code must store the `handle` which is now the 3rd argument to
      all `'added'` events.
    * Client code must be modified to call `handle.release()` (for a successful
      drain and clean close) or `handle.close()` (for failure) and *not* call
      `.destroy()` on the connection, after `'removed'` is emitted.

Bugs fixed:

 - #77, #72, #73 rewrite of connection management FSMs. Solves a swathe of
   issues around error handling and protocols that don't keep-alive idle
   connections.
 - #83 new "internals" guide to explain the design and implementation of the
   library for new developers
 - #75 doc fix for optional parameters that are actually required
 - #82 pools should error-out all outstanding claims when entering "failed"
   state

Bugs fixed:

 - #70 possible crash whenever using the kang "pool monitor" feature.
 - #76 silenced spurious EventEmitter "leak" warnings

### v1.3.1

Maintenance release.

Bugs fixed:

 - #69 clearer log messages around connection attempts, failures and delays
