## v2.x

### v2.0.0

New major release, due to API change in `ConnectionSet`.

API changes:

 - `ConnectionSet` now requires the use of handles to indicate when connections
   have been drained.
    * Client code must store the `handle` which is now the 3rd argument to
      all `'added'` events.
    * Client code must be modified to call `handle.release()` (for a successful
      drain and clean close) or `handle.close()` (for failure) and *not* call
      `.destroy()` on the connection, after `'removed'` is emitted.

Bugs fixed:

 - #77, #72, #73 rewrite of connection management FSMs. Solves a swathe of
   issues around error handling and protocols that don't keep-alive idle
   connections.
 - #83 new "internals" guide to explain the design and implementation of the
   library for new developers
 - #75 doc fix for optional parameters that are actually required
 - #82 pools should error-out all outstanding claims when entering "failed"
   state

Bugs fixed:

 - #70 possible crash whenever using the kang "pool monitor" feature.
 - #76 silenced spurious EventEmitter "leak" warnings

### v1.3.1

Maintenance release.
