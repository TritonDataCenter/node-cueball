## v2.x

### v2.2.3

Maintenance release.

Bugs fixed:

 - #105 Agent pinger logs at INFO level on success. Much logs. Very noise.

### v2.2.2

 - Fix-up for 2.2.1 being broken (lib/agent.js missing)

### v2.2.1

Maintenance release.

WARNING: This release is broken. Do not use it.

Bugs fixed:

 - #102 HTTP Agent pinger hangs. HttpAgent's "ping" option has been broken
   since 2.0.0.
 - #103 pinger running should not trigger creation of more connections

### v2.2.0

New minor release, due to addition of new API.

API changes:

 - The `DNSResolver` class is now exported in the package root, as specified
   in the documentation. It was mistakenly left out.
 - Users of `ConnectionSet` can now supply the option `connectionHandlesError`
   to avoid the need to add a no-op `"error"` handler when using a `constructor`
   that already handles errors.

### v2.1.1

Maintenance release.

Bugs fixed:

 - #92 ConnectionSet emits 'removed' for connection it never 'added' -- this
   release is now actually safe to use with Moray.
 - #93 kang payload missing "options.domain" etc -- makes Kang snapshots a lot
   easier to read
 - #95, #79, #97 logging improvements, reduction of many ERROR level logs to
   WARNINGS since applications may not treat a given cueball pool as fatal
 - #96 crash in Pool#on_resolver_removed when FSM already stopped, happens most
   easily in cases where there is nameserver "flapping"
 - #94 ConnectionSet needs better protection against removing its last working
   connection
 - #98 test coverage for Kang monitor

### v2.1.0

New minor release, due to relaxation of API requirements.

API changes:

 - `Connection` interface implementations (i.e. implementers of the objects
   that are returned by the `constructor` parameter) are no longer required to
   implement `#ref()` or `#unref()`.

Bugs fixed:

 - #85 documentation improvements and re-organization
 - #26 clarified that programs that wish to exit cleanly without calling
   `process.exit()` must call `.stop()` on agents or pools.
 - #90 ensure cueball works with node 0.10
 - #88 correct a bug that cause a crash bringing up a backend after pool failure

### v2.0.1

Bugs fixed:

 - #86 pool monitor broken on csets (kang endpoint always returns InternalError)

### v2.0.0

New major release, due to API change in `ConnectionSet`.

API changes:

 - `ConnectionSet` now requires the use of handles to indicate when connections
   have been drained.
    * Client code must store the `handle` which is now the 3rd argument to
      all `'added'` events.
    * Client code must be modified to call `handle.release()` (for a successful
      drain and clean close) or `handle.close()` (for failure) and *not* call
      `.destroy()` on the connection, after `'removed'` is emitted.

Bugs fixed:

 - #77, #72, #73 rewrite of connection management FSMs. Solves a swathe of
   issues around error handling and protocols that don't keep-alive idle
   connections.
 - #83 new "internals" guide to explain the design and implementation of the
   library for new developers
 - #75 doc fix for optional parameters that are actually required
 - #82 pools should error-out all outstanding claims when entering "failed"
   state

## v1.x

### v1.3.2

Maintenance release.

Bugs fixed:

 - #70 possible crash whenever using the kang "pool monitor" feature.
 - #76 silenced spurious EventEmitter "leak" warnings

### v1.3.1

Maintenance release.

Bugs fixed:

 - #69 clearer log messages around connection attempts, failures and delays
 - #71 some additional assertions related to #70
 - #61 handling `null` as well as `undefined` for optional settings
